One trending theme within research on learning and teaching is an emphasis on artificial intelligence. While AI offers opportunities in the educational arena, blindly replacing human involvement is not the answer. Instead, current research suggests that the key lies in harnessing the strengths of both humans and AI to create a more effective and beneficial learning and teaching experience. Thus, the importance of ‘humans in the loop’ is becoming a central tenet of educational AI. As AI technology advances at breakneck speed, every area of society, including education, needs to engage with and explore the implications of this phenomenon. Therefore, this paper aims to assist in this process by examining the impact of AI on education from researchers’ and practitioners’ perspectives. The authors conducted a Delphi study involving a survey administered to international professionals followed by in-depth face-to-face discussions with a panel of international researchers to identify key trends and challenges for deploying AI in education. The results indicate
that the three most important and impactful trends were privacy and ethical use of AI; the importance of trustworthy algorithms; and equity and fairness. Unsurprisingly, these were also identified as the three key challenges. Based on these findings, the paper outlines policy recommendations for AI in education and suggests a research agenda for closing identified research gaps.

Artificial intelligence is finding its way into people’s everyday lives at breathtaking speed and with almost unlimited possibilities. Typical points of contact with AI include pattern, image and speech recognition, auto-completion or correction suggestions for digital search queries. Since the 1950s, AI has been recognised in computer science and interdisciplinary fields such as philosophy, cognitive science, neuroscience, and economics. AI refers to the attempt to develop machines that can do things that were previously only possible using human cognition. In contrast to humans, however, AI systems can process much more data in real-time.
AI in education represents a generic term to describe a wide collection of different technologies, algorithms, and related multimodal data applied in education’s formal, non-formal, and informal contexts. It involves techniques such as data mining, machine learning, natural language processing, large language models, generative models, and neural networks. The still-emerging field of AI in education has introduced new frameworks, methodological approaches, and empirical investigations into educational research; for example, novel methods in academic research include machine learning, network analyses, and empirical approaches based on computational modelling experiments.
With the emerging opportunities of AI, learning and teaching may be supported in situ and in real-time for more efficient and valid solutions. Hence, AI has the potential to further revolutionise the integration of human and artificial intelligence and impact human and machine collaboration in learning and teaching. The discourse around the utilization of AI in education shifted from being narrowly focused on automation-based tasks to the augmentation of human capabilities linked to learning and teaching. Notably, the concept of ‘humans in the loop’ has gained more traction in recent education discourse as concerns about ethics, risks, and equity emerge.
Due to the remaining challenges of implementing meaningful AI in educational contexts, especially for more sophisticated tasks, the reciprocal collaboration of humans and AI might be a suitable approach for enhancing the capacities of both. However, the importance of understanding how AI, as a stakeholder among humans, selects and acquires data in the process of learning and knowledge creation, learns to process and forget information, and shares knowledge with collaborators is yet to be empirically investigated.
This paper is based on a literature review focussing on the impact of AI in the context of education, a Delphi study involving international professionals and a focus discussion on current opportunities and challenges of AI as well as utlining policy recommendations and a research agenda for closing identified. 


The evolution of Artificial Intelligence in education has witnessed a profound transformation over recent years, holding tremendous promise for the future of learning. As we stand at the convergence of technology and education, the potential impact of AI is poised to reshape traditional educational paradigms in multifaceted ways. Through supporting personalised learning experiences, AI has showcased its ability to cater to individual student needs, offering tailored curricula and adaptive assessments. This customisability of education fosters a more inclusive and effective learning environment, accommodating diverse learning needs and regulations. Moreover, AI tools augment the role of educators by automating administrative tasks, enabling them to allocate more time to mentoring, fostering creativity, and critical thinking. However, the proliferation of AI in education also raises pertinent ethical concerns, including data privacy, algorithmic biases, and the digital divide. Addressing these concerns requires a conscientious approach, emphasising transparency, equity, and responsible AI development and deployment. In addition, in recent years, the emergence of generative AI, such as ChatGPT, is expected to facilitate interactive learning and assist instructors, while concerns such as the generation of incorrect information and privacy issues are also being addressed. Looking forward, the future of AI in education holds tremendous potential for transformation of learning and teaching. Yet, realising the full potential of AI in education necessitates concerted efforts from stakeholders—educators, policymakers, technologists, and researchers—to collaborate, innovate, and navigate the evolving ethical and pedagogical considerations. Embracing AI’s potential while safeguarding against its pitfalls will be crucial in harnessing its power to create a more equitable, accessible, and effective educational arena.
